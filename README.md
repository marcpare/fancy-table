Fiddling around with different techniques for fancy tables.

Looking for

1. Reorder columns
2. Button in header to hide/show columns

index.html
---

dragtable jquery/jquery.ui plugin

doesn't render properyl

index2.html
---

dragtable.js plugin (different than previous)

a very minimal implementation. Doesn't trigger events.

index3.html
---

Playing around creating view classes from the DOM. Works ok! But annoying to manipulating the columns of tables. This leads me to Slickgrid:

SlickGrid/play/index4.html

Try it with SlickGrid. Wow there is good stuff. Column reordering, column finding. This is it!
